# b) Objectives attempted

I have attempted

### `obj 1 (partial)`

Made use of react but not typescript.
Had issues trying to integrate typescript into the project.
No experience using typescript. I may need more time to be able to make use of typescript. However, I have experience using java and thus I feel that I would not have a lot of issues picking this up with more time allocated.

### `obj 2 (completed)`

Made use of conditional rendering to have a not yet loaded page when user have not clicked in on the selected profile to view

### `obj 3 (completed)`

Done. Can easily switch between users. Have also implemented state persistence so that refresh does not clear the selected users.

### `obj 4 (completed)`

Fully responsive using react-bootstrap

### `obj 5 (completed)`
